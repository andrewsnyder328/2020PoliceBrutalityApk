# 2020PoliceBrutalityApk
This is where I will keep the most recent version of my Police Brutality 2020 app.

Click on the PoliceBrutality2020 file, and then the "download" button to get the apk (App installer).
When it downloads, your phone should prompt you to authorize unknown sources. Go ahead and do whatever it asks, this is a safe app with no required (dangerous) permissions. The app will work offline, it only needs to be connected to fetch newer data.

If you run into any issues, make sure your device is running at least Android Marshmallow (6.0)

The source code is currently not public, however if you want to check out the code feel free to decompile it. I recommend Show Java, and app from the Play Store that will show the code from installed or downloaded apps.
